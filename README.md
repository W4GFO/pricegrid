# Single Grid Price Component Project

Hello and thank you for taking an interest in my Frontend Mentor project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Specifically using the TypeScript template:

```
> npx create-react-app price-grid --template typescript
```

## Additional npm installs

In addition to the standard npm packages, I also included the SASS package.

```
> npm install sass
```

## The Four main components which make up the solution are:

1. ParentCardFrame
2. Signup
3. About
4. Join

Each one of the React components is partnered with its corresponding scss file.  

Also, there is a parent scss file for SASS variables to be used thoughout the styling components.
This is the `AllComponentsStyles.scss` file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This is the code which is posted to the github pages section of this repo to demonstrate this solution.
